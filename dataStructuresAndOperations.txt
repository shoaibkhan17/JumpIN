Board class ---

Data Structures: 

The board class uses a 2D array of squares in order to represent the game board. 
We used this data structure because we always know the size of the board beforehand,
and it is coded as a constant. This also makes iterating over the board easier, as 
we can use a nested for-loop with regards to the row and column of squares on the board.
